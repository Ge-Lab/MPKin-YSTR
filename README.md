# MPKin-YSTR
This software program is for analyzing Y-STR haplotypes, primarily  haplotype comparison and kinship analysis. This software was developed with the support from National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 2020-DQ-BX-0018.
There are three major functions implemented in this tool:
1.	Y-STR haplotype comparisons (i.e., 1:1, 1:N, and N:N comparisons)
2.	Pedigree likelihood ratio for kinship analysis with Y-STR profiles, 
3.	Draw mismatch distributions to decide a threshold for determining if two profiles are from the same lineage or not

This software was written by Java, so it may be run on any platform that has the latest version of Java installed.
